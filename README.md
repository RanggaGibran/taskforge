  max_jobs: 3
  
leveling:
  base_exp: 100
  multiplier: 1.2
  max_level: 100
  
database:
  type: "SQLITE"
  sqlite_file: "taskforge.db"
```

### Jobs Config (jobs.yml)

Each job is configured with:
- Display name and description
- Player head texture or item icon
- Objectives with experience, money, and chance values
- Level rewards at specific milestones

## Placeholders (PlaceholderAPI)

- `%taskforge_<job>_level%` - Player's level in job
- `%taskforge_<job>_exp%` - Player's experience in job
- `%taskforge_<job>_exp_required%` - Experience required for next level

- `%taskforge_<job>_name%` - Job display name

## Balancing Philosophy

TaskForge implements several balancing mechanisms:

1. **Low Money & EXP Values**: Prevents instant wealth and encourages long-term play
2. **Chance System**: Not every action gives rewards (configurable 50-90% chances)
3. **Exponential Leveling**: Higher levels require significantly more experience
4. **Material-Based Rewards**: More valuable/rare materials give better rewards
5. **Max Jobs Limit**: Players can only join a limited number of jobs

## Database Schema

The plugin creates three main tables:
- `player_jobs` - Job levels and experience
- `player_stats` - Cumulative statistics  
- `player_settings` - Player preferences
